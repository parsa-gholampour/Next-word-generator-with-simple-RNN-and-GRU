## Contents of `gru.ipynb`
The notebook is structured to guide the user through the following key steps:

1. **Introduction to GRUs**
   - Brief overview of GRU architecture and its advantages over traditional RNNs.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Explanation of the dataset used.
   - Preprocessing steps such as normalization, tokenization, or splitting into training and testing datasets.

3. **Model Construction**
   - Implementation of the GRU-based model using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Discussion of the architecture, including input dimensions, hidden units, and activation functions.

4. **Model Training**
   - Configuration of the training process, including loss functions, optimizers, and metrics.
   - Visualization of the training process (e.g., loss and accuracy plots).

5. **Evaluation and Testing**
   - Performance evaluation on test data.
   - Examples of predictions or outputs generated by the model.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of results and potential applications.
